DESIGNED4PIXELS FRAMEWORK
https://designedforpixels.com

INFORMATION
The Designed4Pixels Framework was originally based on JointsWP http://jointswp.com/, created by Jeremy Englert (@JeremyEnglert). JointsWP is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later, and MIT for Foundation 6.

The Designed4Pixels Framework adds in new features, and creates a new file structure so that the build files and the WordPress theme files are kept separate. The framework uses Sass, Gulp, and other tools to enhance your workflow and allows for the creation of a theme zip file. We use it to develop our Designed4Pixels WordPress Theme.
